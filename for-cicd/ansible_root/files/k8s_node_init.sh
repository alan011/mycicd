===================
I was about to accomplish this script with 'kubeadmin'.
But I am so sorry to say that, cause I'am on working these days and in some kind of busy, I don't have that much time to finish this script and test it.
I found some other solutions on github to init k8s-cluster with ansible, like:
    * https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubespray
    * https://github.com/easzlab/kubeasz

The first one is the solution my current company takes.
